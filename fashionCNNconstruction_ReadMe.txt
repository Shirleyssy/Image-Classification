This piece of code is written to demonstrate how the CNN model for this project is constructed and trained.

However, you don't have to go through the entire training process of 1000 epochs to find the optimum model. The training precedure will end at the 10th epoch. 
Alternatively, we stored the checkpoint that recorded the optimum model we have trained in the folder "mini3_" for you, along with the training and test datasets you need to import.

First, please mount your google drive if you are using it by changing the directory in the first cell in colab. If not, please delete the first cell.
Please change the directory in the second cell to the workplace you want to assign the code to. Please move the folder "mini3_" to the workplace.
Please keep the last folder in the workspace directory as mini3_, because mini3_ folder stores the dataset and checkpoint you need for this code.

after you move the mini3_ folder to the workspace, mount the google drive (optional) and change the directory in the second cell, please hit Runtime>Run all. The code will automatically get executed and go through the training process.
